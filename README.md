# VisBasic_NumMethods
Use of 2 algorithms (Secant and Gauss-Seidel methods) to aproximate the solution of a physics problem. The problem consists in calculating the magnitude of certain resistance so that we obtain certain magnitude if current in the galvanometer in a Wheatstone bridge configuration.
